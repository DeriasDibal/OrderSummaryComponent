## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
 

### What I learned

I’ve gained a solid understanding of customizing CSS by overwriting default styles to suit specific design needs. Additionally, I’ve learned how to implement CSS variables, making the code more efficient and easier to maintain. I now also know how to import Google Fonts to enhance the typography of a website. These skills will significantly improve my ability to create visually appealing and responsive web designs.
 
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Red+Hat+Display:ital,wght@0,300..900;1,300..900&display=swap');

  :root {
       --Pale-blue: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
       --Bright-blue: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
       --Very-pale-blue: hsl(225, 100%, 98%);
       --Desaturated-blue: hsl(224, 23%, 55%);
       --Dark-blue: hsl(223, 47%, 23%);
}
  * {
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 0px;
    box-sizing:border-box;
}
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```
### Continued development

I plan to focus on learning JavaScript to improve the interactivity of websites. This will enable me to create dynamic features and enhance user engagement on my projects.


### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - This helped me for CSS implementation. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing site which helped me finally understand HTML. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept, it provide a step by step learning at your pace.
